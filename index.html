            <p>The three sketches for the Strom Gym app illustrate how USC students can plan, access, and track their workouts efficiently.
                The first sketch focuses on checking gym crowd levels and setting reminders for less busy times.
                The second sketch shows how students can log in, link their Carolina Card, and check in to the gym quickly.
                The third sketch highlights how users can track workouts, view progress, and set new fitness goals, helping them stay motivated and organized.</p>
